# OSM Unicode Coverage

Using OSM extracts from https://download.geofabrik.de/, find areas using each Unicode Block

Excludes Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, and Punctuation. Includes Latin Extended

Lat/lng rounded to nearest two-digits to avoid over-density

Current mapped areas: Antarctica, Australia/Oceania, South America

## Uses

- Removing errors or vandalism (for example, "ÄŒzech RepublikðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿" in New Zealand)
- Locating local hotspots for languages (Antarctic bases, shops catering toward local communities or foreign visitors)
- Highlighting use of less common scripts (for example, some Indian scripts are used only rarely on OSM names)
- Measuring use of dual scripts
- Measuring use of local script / Latin script in foreigner-mapped areas

## Examples
